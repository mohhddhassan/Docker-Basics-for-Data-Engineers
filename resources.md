# 📚 Resources I Found Helpful While Learning Docker (As a Data Engineer Intern)

Here are some resources that personally helped me — simple, beginner-friendly, and directly relevant to what a data engineer might need. I'm still learning, but if you're on a similar path, I hope these help you too!

---

## 🐳 Official Docs & Starters

- [Docker Docs – Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)  
  This was my go-to for the basics. It’s beginner-friendly and explains Docker concepts clearly.

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)  
  I used this to search and pull official images like `postgres`, `clickhouse`, and `python`. Super useful!

## 🎓 Courses & Tutorials

- [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)  
  A free online playground where I tested Docker commands without needing to install anything.

- [Docker Tutorial for Beginners (YouTube - TechWorld with Nana)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE)  
  Very beginner-friendly — I watched this to understand how containers work visually.

- [Docker for Data Engineers (YouTube - Data Engineering Simplified)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo)  
  Helped me understand how Docker is used with tools like Airflow, PostgreSQL, and more.

## 🔧 Tools I Explored

- **Docker Compose**  
  I used it to set up multi-container apps like Airflow (scheduler + webserver + database). It made orchestration easier.

- **Portainer**  
  A GUI for managing Docker — helpful if you prefer a dashboard over CLI.

- **Watchtower**  
  I haven’t used this deeply yet, but I bookmarked it. It auto-updates running containers — useful for production.

## 🔍 Docker Images I Used

These are images I actually pulled and tested:

- `postgres` – Used for practicing SQL locally  
- `clickhouse/clickhouse-server` – For trying out columnar databases  
- `apache/airflow` – Ran my first DAGs inside Docker  
- `python` – Used this to containerize a small script with dependencies

## 💬 Community Support

I still get stuck sometimes — here’s where I go for help:

- [Stack Overflow - Docker Tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker)  
- [Docker Community Forums](https://forums.docker.com/)  
- GitHub issues on official repos (really helpful to find bugs and solutions)

## 📚 Books I’m Exploring

- *Docker Deep Dive* by Nigel Poulton — Clear and detailed, especially good when you want to go beyond just running containers.

## Final Note

I'm still learning Docker, but these resources made it easier for me to grasp the fundamentals and start using it in small projects. I’ll keep updating this list as I learn more.

If you’re starting out like me — don’t rush it, just keep building and experimenting 💪🚀
